    <h1>Parts of a Car That Every Owner Must Know</h1>
    
    <h3>Your car is a super powerful and complex beast. It houses countless components that all work in perfect harmony to run, and even one single malfunctioning part can affect a whole system and impede the car’s performance. While you do not need to know your car ins and outs to provide it with proper maintenance, every car owner get acquainted with the most important parts of a car and their functions.

        In this article, we’re going to take an in-depth look at the most important automobile components and parts that every car owner must know, briefly explain how they work, discuss their importance, as well as useful maintenance tips. 
        
        Even if you are not an absolute gear head but only a regular car owner, you should be familiar with this selected list of the most important and basic car parts and their functions. This guide, and the many links to related comprehensive articles will help you take good care of your beloved vehicle in your own garage.

        Basic Parts of a Car: Most Important Components
    </h2>

    <h3>
        Each and every component in a vehicle has significance, albeit some might be more important than others. Modern day vehicles have become a great deal more complex and have many more parts than their predecessors. 

Although there are many complex parts, some are a mainstay — common and essential for every vehicle. Below are the most basic and at the same time important parts of a car. Understanding how they work and how to maintain them in good shape will mean smoother and hassle-free rides for you as the owner.

        Of course we would start with the engine. The engine is absolutely the heart of the car. This is the most important component of an automobile by all accords. 

The performance of a vehicle depends heavily on its engine. Furthermore, the many components of the engine and the many more related parts are highly prone to wear, therefore the engine tops the list of parts of a car you should get acquainted with.

This complex and delicate powerhouse is made of blocks, head, pistons and valves. Modern automotive engines are also called “internal combustion engines”. This is because the engine generates power for your car to run by creating a combustion inside its chamber. The input for such combustion is a mixture of fuel and air of a precise ratio for optimal result.

Different types of fuels are used by engines including:


Diesel
Ethanol
Gasoline
Electricity

        The engine block is house to engine cylinders, inside of which the pistons move up and down, creating energy. The more cylinders an engine has, the more powerful it is. Engines usually have four, six or eight cylinders.

In a four-stroke engine, during the intake stroke, the intake valve opens. The piston moves downward and moves the crankshaft with it, creating a suction or “vacuum” that sucks in air and fuel, letting them enter the combustion chamber. The valve then closes. How much of this mixture is allowed to enter is controlled by the butterfly throttle, a plate that rotates, in the intake valve. 

When the piston reaches the top of its compression stroke, the mixture is compressed, while the spark plug ignites the compressed mixture and creates a combustion, sending the piston down on its power stroke, which turns the crankshaft. Ultimately that crankshaft combined with the transmission turns your wheels and sends you lickity split on your way to your destination.

When the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke, the exhaust valve opens, pushing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder.

Gear Box (Transmission)
The Gear Box, or transmission, also referred to as a car’s Power Train, comes in at a close second to the engine. This part is what commonly needs attention when vehicles fail. The gear box, when restored, can give new life to even the oldest of vehicles.

The transmission is what contains the different gears that a car needs to shift into depending on speed. These gears transfer the engine’s power to the wheels of the vehicle. 

A transmission is available in two types: the manual and the automatic models.

With manual transmissions, the driver selects gears through the use of a shift lever and clutch pedal. Meanwhile, automatic transmissions can shift through forward gears by itself, and the driver only needs to select between drive (forward) and reverse.

Obviously, an automatic transmission is more convenient and is more popular, however it doesn’t last as long. In addition, some performance enthusiasts argue that you give up control when you opt for an automatic. Interestingly, many seasoned drivers prefer manual transmission as being more fun to drive. 

To learn more helpful DIY maintenance tips for your car’s transmission as well as common problems and how to fix them, consult the comprehensive guides below.

Brakes
While the parts of a car that make it move are vital, so are the components that make it stop. They must work side by side.

Next off the list of important car parts and their functions is the brake system, the failure of which can lead to serious, even fatal accidents. 

Have you ever wondered how a light press on the brake pedal can slow down or stop a gigantic rolling machine? When you press down on the brake pedal, a hydraulic fluid is transmitted through the steel pipes to the wheels of the vehicles. The brakes use the power of hydraulic fluid to transfer the force the driver applies to the brake pedal to a clamping force that slows the vehicle’s wheels.

A manual braking system is one that requires a driver’s intervention for stopping. A later invention the sensor braking system, which can sense the necessity of braking and take action.

    <h2>
        How the braking system works
    </h2>



    <h3>
        The braking system of a car consists of brake rotors, brake calipers and brake pads.

Brake rotors are metal disc made from steel and iron. They connect to the axles, the component that turns the wheels. The brake calipers are clam-like parts that come into contact with both sides of the brake rotors to create friction when you brake.

When you press the brake pedal, the brake calipers clamp on both sides of the brake rotors to slow down the wheels to a stop. 

To increase braking efficiency and minimize wear and tear on the expensive braking system, brake calipers are equipped with pads. These sacrificial pads squeeze on both sides of each brake rotor to slow it down.

Whether you have a manual or sensor braking system, it is very important to maintain and regularly replace the brake parts, which can crack through a lot of beating. Common issues with brakes can be due to rusted calipers that can lock in place, cracked pads, air in your brake lines, or water damage.
